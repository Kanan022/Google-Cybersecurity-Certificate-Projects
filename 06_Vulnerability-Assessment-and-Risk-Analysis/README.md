# 📈 Project 6: Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Analysis

## Project Summary
A formal demonstration of the risk assessment process, culminating in a professional report. This involved defining the scope, identifying potential threat sources and events, calculating risk scores, and proposing a comprehensive remediation strategy for a critical system (a database server).

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Risk Management:** Applied principles of risk analysis, using a methodology (e.g., based on **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**) to determine the likelihood and severity of threats.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identified and documented system vulnerabilities (e.g., open access permissions) and proposed technical controls to mitigate them.
* **Remediation Strategy:** Developed an actionable plan focused on strengthening **Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing** (AAA) mechanisms (e.g., strong passwords, MFA, role-based access).
* **Professional Documentation:** Created a clear, structured report suitable for communicating complex technical risks and mitigation efforts to both technical and managerial stakeholders.

## Deliverable in this Folder
* `Vulnerability-Assessment-Report.docx` - The complete report including the system description, scope, the threat/risk matrix (Likelihood x Severity), and the final remediation strategy.
