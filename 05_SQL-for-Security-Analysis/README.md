# 📊 Project 5: SQL Queries for Security & Log Analysis

## Project Summary
A demonstration of using **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to investigate security incidents and audit user data. This involved writing queries to filter for specific security events in a database (e.g., failed login attempts, specific timeframes) and identify non-compliant users.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Database Forensics:** Using SQL to query and extract security-relevant information from logs and user tables, a foundational skill for threat hunting.
* **SQL Querying:** Proficiency with core SQL filtering clauses: **`SELECT`**, **`WHERE`**, and logical operators **`AND`**, **`OR`**, and **`NOT`**.
* **Pattern Matching:** Utilizing the **`LIKE`** operator with wildcards (`%`) to find patterns in data fields.
* **Security Auditing:** Identifying groups of employees (e.g., those outside the IT department) who require security updates or specific policy enforcement.

## Deliverable in this Folder
* `SQL-Query-Analysis-Report.docx` - The report showcasing SQL queries used to filter employee data and log-in attempts based on criteria such as time, success status, department, and date range.
