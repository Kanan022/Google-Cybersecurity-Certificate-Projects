# 🐧 Project 4: Linux File Permissions Management

## Project Summary
A hands-on technical demonstration of using Linux command-line tools to implement **Access Control** by setting appropriate file and directory permissions (Read, Write, Execute) for users, groups, and others.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Proficiency in using essential Linux commands for system administration and security checks.
* **Access Control:** Applied the principle of **Least Privilege** by modifying permissions to ensure users only have the necessary access to files.
* **Linux Permissions:** Detailed understanding of the 10-character permissions string and the `chmod` command (both symbolic and octal forms).
* **Forensic/Audit:** Used `ls -la` to audit the current state of permissions before and after implementing changes.

## Deliverable in this Folder
* `File-Permissions-Management-Report.docx` - A report showcasing the step-by-step commands (`ls -la`, `chmod`) and screenshots used to modify file and directory permissions in a Linux environment.
