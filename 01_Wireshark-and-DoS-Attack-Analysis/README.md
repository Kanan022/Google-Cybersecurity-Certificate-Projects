# 🔍 Wireshark Network Analysis: Investigating a DoS Attack

## Project Summary
This project involved the forensic analysis of network traffic logs (packet captures) to identify, analyze, and document a cybersecurity incident, following the initial phases of the Incident Response (IR) lifecycle.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Protocol Analysis (TCP/IP):** Identified a **SYN Flood Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack** by analyzing TCP three-way handshake failures.
* **Tool Proficiency:** Utilized log analysis techniques (similar to those used in **Wireshark** or a **SIEM**) to filter and isolate malicious traffic patterns.
* **Incident Response:** Documented findings, determined the attack vector, and authored a professional **Incident Response Report**.
* **Threat Identification:** Identified the single source IP (`203.0.113.0`) responsible for overwhelming the target server (`192.0.2.1`) with SYN requests.
