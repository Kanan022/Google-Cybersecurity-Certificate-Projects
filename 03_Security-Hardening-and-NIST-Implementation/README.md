# ⚙️ Project 3: Security Hardening and Framework Implementation

## Project Summary
This project focuses on the crucial phases of post-incident and proactive security management: applying industry-standard security frameworks and creating actionable remediation plans for network hardening.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Framework Application:** Demonstrated understanding and application of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. 
* **Remediation & Hardening:** Developed a checklist of critical security tasks and tools necessary for network hardening (e.g., firewall maintenance, patch management, port filtering) to mitigate identified risks.
* **Network Traffic Interpretation:** Created foundational documentation on interpreting command-line network monitoring tools like **tcpdump**, demonstrating proficiency in incident analysis preparation.
* **Proactive Security:** Focused on establishing a proactive security posture to reduce the attack surface and improve organizational resilience.
