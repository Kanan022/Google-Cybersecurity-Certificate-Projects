# 🚨 Project 7: SOC Incident Handler's Journal

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates proficiency in the "Detect" and "Respond" phases of the Incident Response lifecycle by documenting the investigation of multiple security events, including phishing, malware analysis, and network intrusion attempts.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Incident Response (IR):** Adhered to standard IR procedures by documenting the **Five Ws** (Who, What, Where, When, Why) and analyzing incident details.
* **Threat Analysis:** Analyzed specific security alerts (e.g., email phishing with malicious attachments, suspicious network activity) and proposed preventative measures.
* **Tool Simulation:** Interpreted outputs from security tools like **Suricata** (IDS/IPS) and analyzed alerts based on custom rules, demonstrating skills common to a SOC Analyst role.
* **Recommendation and Escalation:** Provided sound professional recommendations (e.g., **Do not pay ransom**, block attachments) and properly escalated incidents based on severity.

## Deliverable in this Folder
* `Incident-Handlers-Journal.docx` - A journal containing multiple entries that document security incidents, including the initial analysis, tools used, and proposed remediation steps.
