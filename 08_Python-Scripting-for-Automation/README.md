# 🐍 Project 8: Python Scripting for Security Automation

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates foundational scripting skills by creating a Python algorithm to automate a repetitive security maintenance task: removing unauthorized IP addresses from a file-based access control list (allow list).

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Security Automation:** Applied Python to automate the process of updating an IP allow list, reducing manual error and improving efficiency.
* **Python Programming:** Utilized essential Python concepts including:
    * **File I/O:** Reading (`r`) and writing (`w`) to external text files.
    * **Data Structures:** Converting file content to a list for manipulation (`.split()`, `.join()`).
    * **Control Flow:** Using `for` loops and conditional statements (`if`) to iterate and compare lists.
* **Access Control Maintenance:** Simulated the ongoing management required for network access policies.

## Deliverable in this Folder
* `Security-Automation-Script-Report.docx` - The report detailing the full Python code, including explanations for the functions and methods used to successfully update the IP allow list file.
